Integrally, the only online attacks afforded to the adversary are those inevitable impersonation and dictionary attacks. As opposed to previous modeling, saPAKE addionally requires that any offline password search against the server’s storage takes place after adaptive server compromise. We present OneTwoPAKE, the first saPAKE protocol to simultaneously: 1. realize the full (unweakened ) strong aPAKE functionality; 2. not admit a speedup in an offline password search; (aka, has simulation-rate of 1 ); 3. use only a single round trip, with the client speaking first; and 4. avoid generic algebraic models. Similar to prior work, we instantiate our saPAKE from an OPRF over insecure channels secure against adaptive server compromise. In contrast to prior work, our OPRF is online-extractable and input-committing, enabling our protocol to realize the full saPAKE functionality. Of independent interest are our OPRF functionality and construction. We introduce the first formal model of such an OPRF, and our OPRF protocol is the first Dodis-Yampolskiy-based OPRF proven UC-secure against malicious adversaries without authenticated channels. Our framework demonstrates the feasibility of achieving all of the above properties simultaneously. Though our constructions are not as efficient as those of prior work, our saPAKE boasts the minimal round complexity, achieves full security, and, in terms of idealized models, relies only on the random oracle model. As future work may further close the efficiency gap, our framework may lead to practically deployable solutions.\",\"date\":\"2025-09-02\",\"url\":\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1573\",\"labelSets\":[{\"name\":\"\",\"labels\":[\"PAKE\"]}],\"previousWorks\":[],\"addedDate\":\"2025-09-04T00:42:38.000Z\",\"folder\":\"\",\"isPlaceholder\":false,\"contactEmails\":[],\"extensionSavedAt\":\"2025-09-04T00:42:38.008Z\",\"readingStatus\":\"referenced\"}]",

    "userManualContent": "# MPC Database User Manual\n\nThe MPC Database is a work in progress. The current version is v0.1, and it is likely to contain many bugs and issues. Users are welcome to send their remarks, suggestions, ideas, bug reports, or any other comments to mpc@irif.fr. Please also drop me an email if you would like to contribute to improving the database.\n\n## 1. What the Database Offers\n\nThis database contains research papers on Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and related cryptographic topics. Features include:\n\n- **Comprehensive paper collection** with metadata (title, authors, abstract, venue, date)\n- **Smart labeling system** for categorizing papers by topics, techniques, and applications\n- **Folders & favorites** to organize MPC papers as you like\n- **Reading status tracking** (to-read, reading, read, skimmed, referenced)\n- **Follow-up graph** showing connections between papers\n- **Advanced search** with Boolean logic and field-specific queries\n- **Personal annotations** via scratchpad for each paper\n\nThe current content of the database was obtained by\n- Extracting the list of all ePrint papers from crypto.bib (cf. https://cryptobib.di.ens.fr/)\n- Feeding them to an AI (Claude, by Anthropic) with the following exact prompt:\n\n`I am compiling a list of papers in the area of secure multiparty computation. From the plain text below, could you extract the list of all papers that are about secure computation? It can be either specific forms of secure computation, such as oblivious transfer, multiplication triples, oblivious linear evaluation, private information retrieval, zero-knowledge proofs, eVoting, threshold cryptosystems, secret sharing, commitments, anonymous credentials, or general secure computation protocols.\n\nThings I _don't_ want: I am not interested in group signatures, or auction mechanisms when they are not specifically about securely computing a functionality. I also don't want homomorphic encryption (e.g. faster bootstrapping approaches) unless it's homomorphic encryption used as a tool for securely computing a function. I also don't want searchable encryption, Anonymous Communication, or distributed key generation.`\n\n- Since ePrint only goes back to 1996 and many papers in 1996-2005 were not put on ePrint by their authors, the database was completed by adding one by one all papers pre-2005 (not already on ePrint) from the following prominent (prolific or seminal) MPC/ZK researchers from this period: Yuval Ishai, Oded Goldreich, Shafi Goldwasser, Ivan Damgard, Silvio Micali, Avi Wigderson, Claude Crépeau, and David Chaum.\n\n## 2. Adding Papers\n\nWhen you type in an URL and click \"extract metadata\", the page attempts to automatically extract the metadata from the html of the page. It works reasonably well when it is a page from a website it knows the structure of: see \"supported sources\" below. Note that by default, the CORS mechanism will prevent the page from fetching the metadata this way. This leaves three options:\n- Temporarily disabling CORS. This is what I usually do, via a CORS Unblock extension (e.g., [CORS Unblock](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cors-unblock/hadoojkfknbjgoppkecpgamiajljiief) on Chrome). Note that for Springer, this does not suffice, as it has a more strict CORS policy: you will have to use the second strategy.\n- Parsing metadata via plain text. To do so, go to the paper's page, and copy the text of the full page (ctrl-A or cmd-A), then paste it in the text box. The page will automatically extract the metadata from the plain text. If the plain text is from one of the supported sources, this usually works reasonably well (but sometimes fails for old papers or papers with missing entries).\n- Manually editing the metadata after adding the paper.\n\n**Supported Sources:**\n- ePrint Archive (eprint.iacr.org)\n- ACM Digital Library\n- IEEE Xplore\n- Springer Nature Link\n- Manual entry for other sources\n\n**Batch Adding:**\nWhen you have CORS Unblock activated and expected to work, you can add batches of papers by pasting a list of URLs directly in the text box. It works especially well for adding multiple ePrint papers at once.\n\n**Browser Extension:**\nI made a Chrome browser extension to automatically add papers from the 4 supported sources in one click, directly from the papers' page. It is not currently available widely, but I can consider sharing it in the future, and I can definitely share it on an individual basis upon request.\n\n## 3. Modifying the Database\n\nYou can modify the database in various ways:\n\n- By adding papers, either automatically fetching their metadata if you have CORS Unblock activated or using the manual parsing from the plain text of the paper's page (see above).\n- By editing a paper: changing title, authors, year, abstract, adding previous works, and adding labels.\n- By writing notes on the scratchpad attached to each paper (it supports basic Markdown).\n- By organizing papers into folders, marking papers as favorites, or setting their reading status.\n- By using the batch modification features: after selecting some results of a search, users can add or remove labels in a batch, etc.\n\nWhen you modify the database (add papers, edit metadata, change labels), these changes are stored *locally* in your browser. By default, they are not integrated to the database and will *disappear upon refresh*.\n\n**To keep your changes upon refresh:**\nYou can use the \"disable auto-loading\" button. This setting is tied to your browser (but persistent upon closing it or restarting your computer). Be careful that when you do that, you do not receive any more updates to the database for as long as auto-loading is disabled. You can use this to integrate changes to the database for some time, but I recommend that after some time, you submit your changes to be integrated to the main database, and re-activate auto-load once your changes are integrated.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the \"Export\" feature to export and store the current state of your database in json format (for example, if you want to access it from another machine). You can later restore your state by using the \"Import\" feature. \"Export Full\" additionally exports and stores all the information that is not typically submitted when you submit changes (see below) while \"Export\" only exports information submitted when you submit changes.\n\n**What is not submitted when you submit changes:**\nWhen you submit your changes, the following items are not submitted: what papers you marked as favorites, your reading status, your personal notes in the scratchpads, the folders you created, and their content. These remain attached to your persistent local session (your browser). When you reload the database (by refreshing with auto-loading activated), these are not overwritten by the auto-loading.\n\n**To submit your changes:**\n- Click \"Update DB\" to send your modifications for review\n- Provide your contact information when prompted\n- An email will be sent to mpc@irif.fr with a summary of your changes\n- Changes are reviewed and may be integrated into the main database\n\n**Important:** If changes are not integrated, they will be overwritten when the database is updated.\n\n## 4. Advanced Search Queries\n\nThe database supports complex search queries.\n\n### Basic Text Search\nSimply type keywords to search across titles, authors, and abstracts.\n\n### Field-Specific Queries\n- The following fields can be queried: `author, year, date, title, abstract, email, status`.\n- `author:alice` - Find papers by author Alice\n- `title:protocol` - Find papers with \"protocol\" in the title\n- `date:2024` - Find papers from 2024\n- `year:2024` - Same as date (alternative syntax)\n\nBy default, all queries are case-insensitive and look for any occurrence of the string in the field. The symbol `#` is used to force case-sensitivity. For example, `title:OT` will match \"A New Protocol for Computing X\" (because \"ot\" is a substring of \"protocol), but `title:#OT` will only match papers with \"OT\" (capitalized) in the title.\n\n### Date Range Queries\n- `date:>2020` - Papers after 2020\n- `date:>=2020` - Papers from 2020 onwards\n- `date:<2020` - Papers before 2020\n- `date:<=2020` - Papers up to and including 2020\n- `date:2020-2023` - Papers between 2020 and 2023\n- `date:\"unknown date\"` - Papers with unknown/invalid dates\n\n### Boolean Logic\n\nYou can use Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT) for more complex queries. Quote signs \"...\" can be used to handle blank spaces in queries (e.g., \"author: john doe\", or author:\"john doe\", both are supported), and parentheses to indicate the order of logical operations. \n\nExamples below:\n\n- `author:alice AND title:secure` - Papers by Alice with \"secure\" in title\n- `author:alice OR author:bob` - Papers by Alice or Bob\n- `NOT author:charlie` - Papers not by Charlie\n- `(author:alice OR author:bob) AND date:>2020` - Complex combinations\n- `((\"author:john doe\" AND \"author:jane smith\") OR (\"title:#OT\" AND \"date:>1997\"))`\n- `author:bob AND (title:garbling OR title:obfuscation)`\n- `date:>2015 AND NOT author:excluded`\n\n## 5. Label System and Filtering\n\nYou can additionally search papers via labels. Note that the labelling of papers is far from comprehensive, so be aware that this might miss papers. Consider adding missing labels if you spot any.\n\n### Label Sets\nPapers can have multiple **label sets**, each representing independent contributions or protocols within the same paper. For example, a paper might have:\n- **Set 1**: [\"Any parties\", \"Honest Majority\", \"BGW\"]\n- **Set 2**: [\"2 parties\", \"Malicious\", \"GMW\"]\n\n### Label Search Behavior\nWhen searching with labels, a paper matches if **at least one label set** contains **all selected labels**. This allows papers with multiple contributions to be found accurately.\n\n### Using Label Filters\n- Click labels in the left panel to include them in search\n- Right-click or Ctrl+click to exclude labels\n- Selected labels show in blue, excluded in red\n- Mix label filters with text queries for precise searches\n\n### Favorite Filter\nClick the \"⭐ Favorites\" button to show only papers you've marked as favorites. You can similarly filter papers via their reading status.\n\n## 6. Follow-up Feature and Graph View\n\n### Previous Works\nFor each paper, you can define what previous work it improves upon by:\n- Adding URLs of previous papers during paper entry\n- The system automatically links papers in your database\n- Creates placeholder entries for external papers\n\n### Graph Interactions\n**Follow-up Graph Mode:**\n- Shows connections between papers based on previous works relationships\n- Arrows point from previous work → follow-up work\n\n**Single Click on Node:**\n- Opens the paper metadata\n- Gives the option to open the paper or edit the metadata\n\n**Cmd+Click (Mac) / Ctrl+Click (Windows):**\n- Shows the connected component containing that paper\n- Filters the paper list to show only connected papers\n- Useful for exploring research lineages\n\n**Author Graph Mode:**\n- Connects papers that share common authors\n- Useful for exploring collaborations\n\n## 7. Contact Authors Feature\n\nThis works when the email addresses of the authors could be extracted from the metadata (typically, when the paper was imported from ePrint, but not from other sources).\n\n### Email Template\nWhen you click the email icon (📧) on a paper, it opens your email client with:\n\n**Subject:** `Question about: [Paper Title]`\n\n**Body:**\n```\nDear [Authors],\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask about your paper:\n\n\"[Paper Title]\"\n\n[Your question/comment here]\n\nBest regards,\n[Your name]\n```\n\n### Setting Contact Emails\n- Edit papers to add author email addresses\n- Emails are stored locally and included in exports\n- Multiple emails supported (one per line)\n\n## 8. Reading Status and Organization\n\n### Status Icons\n- 📖 **To Read** - Papers on your reading list\n- 👁️ **Skimmed** - Papers you've briefly reviewed\n- 📚 **Reading** - Papers you're currently reading\n- ✅ **Read** - Papers you've fully read\n- 📝 **Referenced** - Papers you've cited or referenced\n\n### Folder Organization\n- Create custom folders for organizing papers\n- Papers can be moved between folders\n- Folder structure is personal and not shared",

A covert computation protocol is one in which parties am run a protocol without knowing if other parties ore also participating in the protocol or not. At the end of the protocol, if all parties participated in the protocol and if the function output is favorable to all parties, then the output is revealed. Ahn et al. constructed a protocol for covert two-partv computation in the random oracle model In this paper, we offer a construction for covert multiparty computation. Our construction is in the standard model and does not require random oracles. In order to achieve this goal, we introduce a number of new techniques. Central to our work is the development of \\\"zero-knowledge proofs to garbled circuits,\\\" which we believe could be of independent interest. Along the way, we also develop a definition of covert computation as per the Ideal/Real model simulation paradigm.\",\"date\":\"2007-09-30\",\"url\":\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389496\",\"labelSets\":[],\"previousWorks\":[],\"addedDate\":\"2025-08-29T12:12:55.936Z\",\"folder\":\"\",\"readingStatus\":\"to-read\",\"isPlaceholder\":false,\"scratchpad\":\"\",\"contactEmails\":[],\"favorite\":false},{\"id\":1756469534999.836,\"title\":\"Covert two-party computation\",\"authors\":\"Luis von Ahn, Luis von Ahn, Nicholas Hopper, Nicholas Hopper, John Langford, John Langford\",\"abstract\":\"We introduce covert two-party computation , a stronger notion of security than standard secure two-party computation. Like standard secure two-party computation, covert two-party computation allows Alice and Bob, with secret inputs x A and x B respectively, to compute a function f(x A ,x B ) without leaking any additional information about their inputs. In addition, covert two-party computation guarantees that even the existence of a computation is hidden from all protocol participants unless the value of the function mandates otherwise. This allows the construction of protocols that return f(x A ,x B ) only when it equals a certain value of interest (such as \\\"Yes, we are romantically interested in each other\\\") but for which neither party can determine whether the other even ran the protocol whenever f(x A ,x B ) is not a value of interest. Since existing techniques for secure function evaluation always reveal that both parties participate in the computation, covert computation requires the introduction of new techniques based on provably secure steganography. We introduce security definitions for covert two-party computation and show that this surprising notion can be achieved by a protocol given the Decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption in the \\\"honest but curious\\\" model. Using this protocol as a subroutine, we present another protocol which is fair and secure against malicious adversaries in the Random Oracle Model --- unlike most other protocols against malicious adversaries, this protocol does not rely on zero-knowledge proofs (or similar cut-and-choose techniques), because they inherently reveal that a computation took place. We remark that all our protocols are of comparable efficiency to protocols for standard secure two-party computation.\",\"date\":\"2005-05-21\",\"url\":\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1060590.1060668\",\"labelSets\":[],\"previousWorks\":[],\"addedDate\":\"2025-08-29T12:12:14.995Z\",\"folder\":\"\",\"readingStatus\":\"to-read\",\"isPlaceholder\":false,\"scratchpad\":\"\",\"contactEmails\":[],\"extensionSavedAt\":\"2025-08-29T12:12:14.999Z\",\"favorite\":false},{\"id\":1756340276512.81,\"title\":\"VerITAS: Verifying Image Transformations at Scale\",\"authors\":\"Trisha Datta (Stanford University), Binyi Chen (Stanford University), Dan Boneh (Stanford University)\",\"abstract\":\"Verifying image provenance has become an important topic, especially in the realm of news media. To address this issue, the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) developed a standard to verify image provenance that relies on digital signatures produced by cameras. However, photos are usually edited before being published, and a signature on an original photo cannot be verified given only the published edited image. In this work, we describe VerITAS, a system that uses zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) to prove that only certain edits have been applied to a signed photo. While past work has created image editing proofs for photos, VerITAS is the first to do so for realistically large images (30 megapixels). Our key innovation enabling this leap is the design of a new proof system that enables proving knowledge of a valid signature on a large amount of witness data. We run experiments on realistically large images that are more than an order of magnitude larger than those tested in prior work. In the case of a computationally weak signer, such as a camera, we are able to generate a proof of valid edits for a 90 MB image in just over thirteen minutes, costing about $0.54 on AWS per image. In the case of a more powerful signer, we are able to generate a proof of valid edits for a 90 MB image in just over three minutes, costing only $0.13 on AWS per image. Either way, proof verification time is less than a second. Our techniques apply broadly whenever there is a need to prove that an efficient transformation was applied correctly to a large amount of signed private data.\",\"date\":\"2024-07-01\",\"url\":\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1066\",\"labelSets\":[],\"previousWorks\":[],\"addedDate\":\"2025-08-28T00:17:56.508Z\",\"folder\":\"\",\"readingStatus\":\"to-read\",\"isPlaceholder\":false,\"scratchpad\":\"\",\"contactEmails\":[],\"favorite\":false},{\"id\":1756307759338.7954,\"title\":\"A New Approach to Practical Active-Secure Two-Party Computation\",\"authors\":\"Jesper Buus Nielsen (Peter Sebastian Nordholt, Claudio Orlandi, and Sai Sheshank Burra)\",\"abstract\":\"We propose a new approach to practical two-party computation secure against an active adversary.

We also report on an implementation of this approach, that shows that our protocol is more efficient than any previous one: For big enough circuits, we can evaluate more than 20000 Boolean gates per second.
