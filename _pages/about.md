I am a CNRS research scientist at [IRIF][irif], Université de Paris. I received my PhD from École Normale Supérieure de Paris ([ENS][ens]) in November 2017, under the supervision of [David Pointcheval](https://www.di.ens.fr/david.pointcheval/index.php) and [Hoeteck Wee](https://www.di.ens.fr/~wee/). In 2017 -- 2019, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology ([KIT][kit]), in the team of [Dennis Hofheinz](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/dhofheinz/).


My main research interests are secure multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proofs (both foundational and practical aspects), as well as the theoretical foundations of cryptography. For an up-to-date list of my publications, you can check my [publication page][publications], my [dblp profile][dblp], or my [Google scholar profile][scholar]. All my publications become available at some point in open access format on the ePrint archive; see the list [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/eprint-bin/search.pl?authornames=Geoffroy). My PhD thesis can  be found [here](/assets/pdf/thesis.pdf).

#### Students

<!--I have fundings for several master internships, research visits, or PhDs. I am always looking for candidates with a strong academic record to work on projects related to secure computation, zero-knowledge proofs, or foundational aspects of cryptography. Interested? Drop me a mail!-->

<!--Currently, I am specifically looking for a master student to work on a project related to secure computation and coding theory during the period March 2021 -- September 2021 (other periods can be envisioned depending on the student constraints). There is a possibility of continuing this internship as a PhD. You might want to check the [internship proposal](/assets/pdf/internship_codes.pdf).-->
