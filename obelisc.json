We initiate the study of pseudorandom correlation functions (PCFs) that offer the ability to securely generate virtually unbounded sources of correlated randomness using only local computation. Concretely, a PCF is a keyed function 𝐹 𝑘 such that for a suitable joint key distribution ( 𝑘 0 , 𝑘 1 ) , the outputs ( 𝑓 𝑘 0 ( 𝑥 ) , 𝑓 𝑘 1 ( 𝑥 ) ) are indistinguishable from instances of a given target correlation. An essential security requirement is that indistinguishability hold not only for outsiders, who observe the pairs of outputs, but also for insiders who know one of the two keys. We present efficient constructions of PCFs for a broad class of useful correlations, including oblivious transfer and multiplication triple correlations, from a variable-density variant of the Learning Parity with Noise assumption (VDLPN). We also present several cryptographic applications that motivate our efficient PCF constructions. The VDLPN assumption is independently motivated by two additional applications. First, different flavors of this assumption give rise to weak pseudorandom function candidates in depth-2 AC 0 [ ⊕ ] that can be conjectured to have subexponential security, matching the best known learning algorithms for this class. This is contrasted with the quasipolynomial security of previous (higher-depth) AC 0 [ ⊕ ] candidates.  We support our conjectures by proving resilience to several classes of attacks. Second, VDLPN implies simple constructions of pseudorandom generators and weak pseudorandom functions with security against XOR related-key attacks.\",\"date\":\"2020-11-15\",\"url\":\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1417\",\"labelSets\":[],\"previousWorks\":[],\"addedDate\":\"2025-08-15T19:33:06.426Z\",\"folder\":\"\",\"readingStatus\":\"referenced\",\"isPlaceholder\":false,\"scratchpad\":\"\",\"contactEmails\":[\"eboyle@alum.mit.edu\",\"couteau@irif.fr\",\"niv.gilboa@gmail.com\",\"yuvali@cs.technion.ac.il\",\"lisa.kohl@cwi.nl\",\"peter.scholl@cs.au.dk\"],\"favorite\":false},{\"id\":1755286389230.5398,\"title\":\"The Resiliency of MPC with Low Interaction: The Benefit of Making Errors\",\"authors\":\"Benny Applebaum (Eliran Kachlon, and Arpita Patra)\",\"abstract\":\"We study information-theoretic secure multiparty protocols that achieve full security, including guaranteed output delivery, at the presence of an active adversary that corrupts a constant fraction of the parties. It is known that 2 rounds are insufficient for such protocols even when the adversary corrupts only two parties (Gennaro, Ishai, Kushilevitz, and Rabin; Crypto 2002), and that perfect protocols can be implemented in 3 rounds as long as the adversary corrupts less than a quarter of the parties (Applebaum , Brakerski, and Tsabary; Eurocrypt, 2019). Furthermore, it was recently shown that the quarter threshold is tight for any 3-round \\\\emph{perfectly-secure} protocol (Applebaum, Kachlon, and Patra; FOCS 2020). Nevertheless, one may still hope to achieve a better-than-quarter threshold at the expense of allowing some negligible correctness errors and/or statistical deviations in the security. Our main results show that this is indeed the case. Every function can be computed by 3-round protocols with \\\\emph{statistical} security as long as the adversary corrupts less than a third of the parties. Moreover, we show that any better resiliency threshold requires 4 rounds. Our protocol is computationally inefficient and has an exponential dependency in the circuit's depth 𝑑 and in the number of parties 𝑛 . We show that this overhead can be avoided by relaxing security to computational, assuming the existence of a non-interactive commitment (NICOM). Previous 3-round computational protocols were based on stronger public-key assumptions. When instantiated with statistically-hiding NICOM, our protocol provides \\\\emph{everlasting statistical} security, i.e., it is secure against adversaries that are computationally unlimited \\\\emph{after} the protocol execution. To prove these results, we introduce a new hybrid model that allows for 2-round protocols with a linear resiliency threshold. Here too we prove that, for perfect protocols, the best achievable resiliency is 𝑛 / 4 , whereas statistical protocols can achieve a threshold of 𝑛 / 3 . In the plain model, we also construct the first 2-round 𝑛 / 3 -statistical verifiable secret sharing that supports second-level sharing and prove a matching lower-bound, extending the results of Patra, Choudhary, Rabin, and Rangan (Crypto 2009). Overall, our results refine the differences between statistical and perfect models of security and show that there are efficiency gaps even for thresholds that are realizable in both models.

This is particularly true for zero-knowledge, which is a special case of 2PC. In fact, in the special case of zero knowledge, optimal protocols with unconditional security against one of the two players have also been meticulously studied and constructed. On the other hand, general-purpose maliciously secure 2PC with statistical or unconditional security against one of the two participants has remained largely unexplored so far. In this work, we initiate the study of such protocols, which we refer to as 2PC with one-sided statistical security. We settle the round complexity of 2PC with one-sided statistical security with respect to black-box simulation by obtaining the following tight results: In a setting where only one party obtains an output, we design  2PC in 4 rounds with statistical security against receivers and computational security against senders. In a setting where both parties obtain outputs, we design 2PC in 5 rounds with computational security against the party that obtains output first and statistical security against the party that obtains output last. Katz and Ostrovsky (CRYPTO 2004) showed that 2PC with black-box simulation requires at least 4 rounds when one party obtains an output and 5 rounds when both parties obtain outputs, even when only computational security is desired against both parties. Thus in these settings, not only are our results tight, but they also show that statistical security is achievable at no extra cost to round complexity. This still leaves open the question of whether 2PC can be achieved with black-box simulation in 4 rounds with statistical security against senders and computational security against receivers.  Based on a lower bound on computational zero-knowledge proofs due to Katz (TCC 2008), we observe that the answer is negative unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses.\",\"date\":\"2020-11-15\",\"url\":\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1428\",\"labelSets\":[],\"previousWorks\":[],\"addedDate\":\"2025-08-15T19:33:12.341Z\",\"folder\":\"\",\"readingStatus\":\"referenced\",\"isPlaceholder\":false,\"scratchpad\":\"\",\"contactEmails\":[\"dakshita@illinois.edu\",\"mughees2@illinois.edu\"],\"favorite\":false},{\"id\":1755286398077.5823,\"title\":\"On Computational Shortcuts for Information-Theoretic PIR\",\"authors\":\"Matthew M.

That is, it is guaranteed that the only deductions regarding the truthfulness of such representations, made by an outsider who has witnessed the communication among the parties,  are the ones that can be drawn just from the represented inputs and outputs alone. To date, all incoercible  secure computation protocols  withstand coercion of only a fraction of the parties, or else assume that all parties use an  execution environment that makes some crucial parts of their local states physically inaccessible even to themselves. We consider, for the first time, the  setting where all parties are coerced, and the coercer expects to see the entire history of the computation. We allow both protocol participants and external attackers to access a common reference string which is generated once and for all by an uncorruptable trusted party. In this setting we construct: -  A general  multi-party function evaluation protocol, for any number of parties, that withstands coercion of all parties, as long as all parties use the prescribed ``faking algorithm'' upon coercion.  This holds even if the inputs and outputs represented by coerced parties are globally inconsistent with the evaluated function. - A general two-party function evaluation protocol  that withstands even  the %``mixed'' case where some of the coerced parties do follow the prescribed faking algorithm. (For instance, these parties might collude  with the coercer and disclose their true local states.) This protocol is limited to  functions where the input of at least one of the parties is taken from a small (poly-size) domain. It uses fully deniable encryption with public deniability for one of the parties; when instantiated using the fully deniable encryption of Canetti, Park, and Poburinnaya (Crypto'20), it takes 3 rounds of communication. Both protocols operate in the common reference string model, and use  fully bideniable encryption (Canetti Park and Poburinnaya, Crypto'20) and sub-exponential indistinguishability obfuscation.

This leaves open the question of obtaining communication efficient protocols that are secure against malicious adversaries in the plain model, which we present in this work. Concretely, our two main contributions are: 1) We provide a round-preserving black-box compiler that compiles a wide class of MPC protocols into circuit-scalable maliciously secure MPC protocols in the plain model, assuming (succinct) FE combiners. 2) We provide a round-preserving black-box compiler that compiles a wide class of MPC protocols into circuit-independent— i.e., with a CC that depends only on the input-output length of the circuit—maliciously secure MPC protocols in the plain model, assuming Multi-Key Fully-Homomorphic Encryption (MFHE). Our constructions are based on a new compiler that turns a wide class of MPC protocols into k-delayed-input function MPC protocols (a notion we introduce), where the function that is being computed is specified only in the k-th round of the protocol. As immediate corollaries of our two compilers, we derive (1) the first round-optimal and circuit-scalable maliciously secure MPC protocol, and (2) the first round-optimal and circuit-independent maliciously secure MPC protocol in the plain model.

In a nutshell, a bilinear group arithmetic circuit is a standard arithmetic circuit augmented with special gates capturing group exponentiations or pairings. Such circuits are highly relevant, e.g., in the context of zero-knowledge statements over pairing-based languages. As expressing these special gates in terms of a standard arithmetic circuit results in a significant overhead in circuit size, an approach to zero-knowledge via standard arithmetic circuits may incur substantial additional costs. The approach due to Lai et al. shows how to avoid this by integrating additional zero-knowledge techniques into the Bulletproof framework so as to handle the special gates very efficiently. We take a different approach by generalizing Compressed Σ -Protocol Theory (CRYPTO 2020) from arithmetic circuit relations to bilinear group arithmetic circuit relations. Besides its conceptual simplicity, our approach has the practical advantage of reducing the communication costs of Lai et al.'s protocol by roughly a multiplicative factor 3. Finally, we show an application of our results which may be of independent interest.

The most important factor in the efficiency of a solution is the multiplicative depth of the homomorphic circuit. Two prior works have given circuits with multiplicative depth of five per training iteration. We optimize one of these solutions, by Han et al.

Our protocol only includes oblivious transfer (OT) extension and garbled Bloom filter as its main ingredients and avoids computationally expensive operations.  From a communication pattern perspective, the protocol consists of two types of interactions. The first type is performed over a star-like communication graph in which one designated party interacts with all other parties via performing OTs as the sender. Besides, parties communicate through a path-like communication graph that involves sending a garbled Bloom filter from the first party to its neighboring party following the last one. This design makes our protocol to be highly scalable due to the independence of each party's complexity from the number of participating parties and thus causes a communication and computation complexities of 𝑂 ( 𝑛 𝜆 𝑘 ) , where 𝑛 is the set size, 𝑘 is the number of hash functions, and 𝜆 is the security parameter.

Smart contracts, in a nutshell, are digitally executed contracts wherein some parties execute a common goal. The main problem with most of the current smart contracts is that there is no privacy for a party's input to the contract from either the blockchain or the other parties. Our research builds on the Hawk project that provides transaction privacy along with support for smart contracts. However, Hawk relies on a special trusted party known as a manager, which must be trusted not to leak each party's input to the smart contract.

This model is denoted as ``Almost asynchronous'' MPC. Yet, their work [BHN] has limitations: (i) \\\\emph{Setup assumptions:} their protocol is based on an encryption scheme, with homomorphic additivity,  which requires that a trusted entity gives to players secret shares of a global decryption key ahead of the protocol.

Until recently, it was widely believed that a GC proportional to the entire program, including parts of the program that are entirely discarded due to conditional branching, must be transmitted over a network. Recent work shows that this belief is false, and that communication proportional only to the longest program execution path suffices (Heath and Kolesnikov, CRYPTO 20, [HK20a]). Although this recent work reduces needed communication, it increases computation. For a conditional with 𝑏 branches, the players use 𝑂 ( 𝑏 2 ) computation (traditional GC uses only 𝑂 ( 𝑏 ) ). Our scheme LogStack reduces stacked garbling computation from 𝑂 ( 𝑏 2 ) to 𝑂 ( 𝑏 log ⁡ 𝑏 ) with no increase in communication over [HK20a]. The cause of [HK20a]'s increased computation is the oblivious collection of garbage labels that emerge during the evaluation of inactive branches. Garbage is collected by a multiplexer that is costly to generate. At a high level, we redesign stacking and garbage collection to avoid quadratic scaling. Our construction is also more space efficient: [HK20a] algorithms require 𝑂 ( 𝑏 ) space, while ours use only 𝑂 ( log ⁡ 𝑏 ) space. This space efficiency allows even modest setups to handle large numbers of branches. [HK20a] assumes a random oracle (RO). We track the source of this need, formalize a simple and natural added assumption on the base garbling scheme, and remove reliance on RO: LogStack is secure in the standard model. Nevertheless, LogStack can be instantiated with typical GC tricks based on non-standard assumptions, such as free XOR and half-gates, and hence can be implemented with high efficiency. We implemented LogStack (in the RO model, based on half-gates garbling) and report performance. In terms of wall-clock time and for fewer than 16 branches, our performance is comparable to [HK20a]'s; for larger branching factors, our approach clearly outperforms [HK20a].

In this paper, we show that by leaving condition (3), secure computation with information-theoretic security against a semi-honest adversary is possible with k&#8804;n<2k-1. In addition, we clarify the advantage of using secret information that has been encrypted with a random number as input to secure computation. One of the advantages is the acceleration of the computation time.

To thwart access pattern leakage, the literature has focused on {\\\\it oblivious} algorithms, where obliviousness requires that the access patterns leak nothing about the input data. In this paper, we consider the {\\\\tt Join} operator, an important database primitive that has been extensively studied and optimized. Unfortunately, any {\\\\it fully oblivious} {\\\\tt Join} algorithm would require {\\\\it always} padding the result to the {\\\\it worst-case} length which is {\\\\it quadratic} in the data size 𝑁 . In comparison, an insecure baseline incurs only 𝑂 ( 𝑅 + 𝑁 ) cost where 𝑅 is the true result length, and in the common case in practice, 𝑅 is relatively short. As a typical example, when 𝑅 = 𝑂 ( 𝑁 ) , any fully oblivious algorithm must inherently incur a prohibitive, 𝑁 -fold slowdown relative to the insecure baseline. Indeed, the (non-private) database and algorithms literature invariably focuses on studying the {\\\\it instance-specific} rather than {\\\\it worst-case} performance of database algorithms. Unfortunately, the stringent notion of full obliviousness precludes the design of efficient algorithms with non-trivial instance-specific performance. To overcome this worst-case performance barrier of full obliviousness and enable algorithms with good instance-specific performance, we consider a relaxed notion of access pattern privacy called -differential obliviousness (DO), originally proposed in the seminal work of Chan et al. (SODA'19). Rather than insisting that the access patterns leak no information whatsoever, the relaxed DO notion requires that the access patterns satisfy -differential privacy. We show that by adopting the relaxed DO notion, we can obtain efficient database {\\\\tt Join} mechanisms whose instance-specific performance {\\\\it approximately matches} the insecure baseline, while still offering a meaningful notion of privacy to individual users. Complementing our upper bound results, we also prove new lower bounds regarding the performance of any DO {\\\\tt Join} algorithm. Differential obliviousness (DO) is a new notion and is a relatively unexplored territory. Following the pioneering investigations by Chan et al. and others, our work is among the very first to formally explore how DO can help overcome the worst-case performance curse of full obliviousness; moreover, we motivate our work with database applications.

In this work, we show that multiplication triples can be re-used across conditional branches. For a circuit with 𝑏 branches, each having 𝑛 AND gates, we need only a total of 𝑛 triples, rather than the typically required 𝑏 ⋅ 𝑛 .

Given broadcast, we give tight bounds for the necessary and sufficient setup cardinality, i.e. number of participating parties, for UC-MPC protocols with Identifiable Abort. Concretely, we improve previous upper bounds by constructing Secure Function Evaluation for 𝑛 parties ( ℎ of which are honest) from setups of cardinality 𝛽 := min ( 𝑛 , ⌊ 𝑛 / ℎ ⌋ + ⌊ ( 𝑛 − 1 ) / ℎ ⌋ − 1 ) and broadcast. Conversely, we present the first general lower bound on the minimal setup cardinality for Identifiable Abort by proving that setups of cardinality 𝛽 − 1 plus broadcast are insufficient even for a commitment among 𝑛 parties. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that Oblivious Transfer plus broadcast is sufficient for 𝑛 = 2 ℎ ≥ 2 which is consistent with the fact that in two-party MPC Identifiable Abort comes for free.

In the honest-majority setting -- the focus of this work -- Ananth et al. [CRYPTO'18, EC'19], Applebaum et al. [TCC'18, EC'19] and Garg et al. [TCC'18] have established the feasibility of general two-round MPC in standard communication models involving broadcast (BC) and private point-to-point (P2P) channels. In this work, we set out to understand what features of the communication model are necessary for these results, and more broadly the design of two-round MPC. Focusing our study on the plain model -- the most natural model for honest-majority MPC -- we obtain the following results: 1. Dishonest majority from Honest majority: In the two round setting, honest-majority MPC and dishonest-majority MPC are surprisingly close, and often equivalent. This follows from our results that the former implies 2-message oblivious transfer, in many settings. (i) We show that without private point-to-point (P2P) channels, i.e., when we use only broadcast (BC) channels,  honest-majority MPC implies 2-message oblivious transfer. (ii) Furthermore, this implication holds even when we use both P2P and BC, provided that the MPC protocol is robust against ``fail-stop'' adversaries. 2.  Best-Achievable Security: While security with guaranteed output delivery (and even fairness) against malicious adversaries is impossible in two rounds, nothing is known with regards to the ``next best'' security notion, namely, security with identifiable abort (IA). We show that IA is also impossible to achieve with honest-majority even if we use both P2P and BC channels. However, if we replace P2P channels with a ``bare'' (i.e., untrusted) public-key infrastructure (PKI), then even security with guaranteed output delivery (and hence IA) is possible to achieve. These results ``explain'' that the reliance on P2P channels (together with BC) in the recent two-round protocols in the plain model was in fact necessary, and that these protocols couldn't have achieved a stronger security guarantee, namely, IA. Overall, our results (put together with prior works) fully determine the best-achievable security for honest-majority MPC in different communication models in two rounds. As a consequence, they yield the following hierarchy of communication models: BC < P2P < BC+P2P < BC+PKI This shows that BC channel is the weakest communication model, and that BC+PKI model is strictly stronger than BC+PTP model.\",\"date\":\"2021-05-28\",\"url\":\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/690\",\"labelSets\":[],\"previousWorks\":[],\"addedDate\":\"2025-08-15T19:57:08.702Z\",\"folder\":\"\",\"readingStatus\":\"referenced\",\"isPlaceholder\":false,\"scratchpad\":\"\",\"contactEmails\":[\"aarushig@cs.jhu.edu\",\"abhishek@cs.jhu.edu\",\"mp@cse.iitb.ac.in\",\"mrrajeev@cse.iitb.ac.in\"],\"favorite\":false},{\"id\":1755287831781.0679,\"title\":\"SoK: Privacy-Preserving Computing in the Blockchain Era\",\"authors\":\"Ghada Almashaqbeh and Ravital Solomon\",\"abstract\":\"Privacy is a huge concern for cryptocurrencies and blockchains as most of these systems log everything in the clear.

Recent works have expanded to support more generalized forms of private computation. Such solutions tend to be highly involved as they rely on advanced cryptographic primitives and creative techniques to handle issues related to dealing with private records (e.g. concurrency and double spending). This situation makes it hard to comprehend the current state-of-the-art, much less build on top of it. To address these challenges, we develop a systematization of knowledge for privacy-preserving solutions in blockchain. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first of its kind. After motivating design challenges, we devise two systematization frameworks---the first as a stepping stone to the second---and use them to study the state-of-the-art. For our first framework, we study the zero-knowledge proof systems used in surveyed solutions, based on their key features and limitations. Our second is for blockchain privacy-preserving solutions; we define several dimensions to categorize the surveyed schemes and, in doing so, identify two major paradigms employed to achieve private computation.

In this work, we study this problem of two-round private set intersection (PSI) with low (asymptotically optimal) communication cost, or what we call laconic private set intersection ( ℓ PSI) and its extensions. This problem is inspired by the recent general frameworks for laconic cryptography [Cho et al. CRYPTO 2017, Quach et al. FOCS'18]. We start by showing the first feasibility result for realizing ℓ PSI based on the CDH assumption, or LWE with polynomial noise-to-modulus ratio. However, these feasibility results use expensive non-black-box cryptographic techniques leading to significant inefficiency. Next, with the goal of avoiding these inefficient techniques, we give a construction of ℓ PSI schemes making only black-box use of cryptographic functions. Our construction is secure against semi-honest receivers, malicious senders and reusable in the sense that the receiver's message can be reused across any number of executions of the protocol. The scheme is secure under the 𝜙 -hiding, decisional composite residuosity and subgroup decision assumptions.

This underscores the need for privacy-preserving ML (PPML) systems, and has inspired a line of research into how such systems can be constructed efficiently. We contribute to this line of research by proposing a framework that allows efficient and secure evaluation of full-fledged state-of-the-art ML algorithms via secure multi-party computation (MPC). This is in contrast to most prior works on PPML, which require advanced ML algorithms to be substituted with approximated variants that are ``MPC-friendly'', before MPC techniques are applied to obtain a PPML algorithm. A drawback of the latter approach is that it requires careful fine-tuning of the combined ML and MPC algorithms, and might lead to less efficient algorithms or inferior quality ML (such as lower prediction accuracy). This is an issue for secure training of DNNs in particular, as this involves several arithmetic algorithms that are thought to be ``MPC-unfriendly'', namely, integer division, exponentiation, inversion, and square root extraction. In this work, we propose secure and efficient protocols for the above seemingly MPC-unfriendly computations (but which are essential to DNN). Our protocols are three-party protocols in the honest-majority setting, and we propose both passively secure and actively secure with abort variants. A notable feature of our protocols is that they simultaneously provide high accuracy and efficiency. This framework enables us to efficiently and securely compute modern ML algorithms such as Adam (Adaptive moment estimation) and the softmax function ``as is'', without resorting to approximations. As a result, we obtain secure DNN training that outperforms state-of-the-art three-party systems; our \\\\textit{full} training is up to times faster than just the \\\\textit{online} phase of the recently proposed FALCON (Wagh et al. at PETS'21) on the standard benchmark network for secure training of DNNs.

Nonetheless, Blum’s famous coin-tossing protocol(CRYPTO’81) achieves a strictly weaker “game-theoretic” notion of fairness — specifically, it is a 2-party coin toss protocol in which neither party can bias the outcome towards its own preference; and thus the honest protocol forms a Nash equilibrium in which neither party would want to deviate. Surprisingly, an n-party analog of Blum’s famous coin toss protocol was not studied till recently. The elegant work by Chung et al. was the first to explore the feasibility of game-theoretically fair n-party coin toss in the presence of corrupt majority. We may assume that each party has a publicly stated preference for either the bit 0 or 1, and if the outcome agrees with the party’s preference, it obtains utility 1; else it obtains nothing.A natural game-theoretic formulation is to require that the honest protocol form a coalition-resistant Nash equilibrium, i.e., no coalition should have incentive to deviate from the honest behavior. Chung et al.  phrased this game-theoretic notion as “cooperative-strategy-proofness”or “CSP-fairness” for short. Unfortunately, Chung et al. showed that under (n-1)-sized coalitions, it is impossible to design such a CSP-fair coin toss protocol, unless all parties except one prefer the same bit.In this paper, we show that the impossibility of Chung et al. is in fact not as broad as it may seem. When coalitions are majority but not n-1 in size, we can indeed get feasibility results in some meaningful parameter regimes. We give a complete characterization of the regime in whichCSP-fair coin toss is possible, by providing a matching upper- and lower-bound. Our complete characterization theorem also shows that the mathematical structure of game-theoretic fairness is starkly different from the de facto strong fairness notion in the multi-party computation literature.\",\"date\":\"2021-06-07\",\"url\":\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/748\",\"labelSets\":[],\"previousWorks\":[],\"addedDate\":\"2025-08-15T19:58:31.743Z\",\"folder\":\"\",\"readingStatus\":\"referenced\",\"isPlaceholder\":false,\"scratchpad\":\"\",\"contactEmails\":[\"kew2@andrew.cmu.edu\"],\"favorite\":false},{\"id\":1755287915100.812,\"title\":\"Three Halves Make a Whole?

In real-life applications, features are often numerical. The standard ``in the clear'' algorithm to grow decision trees on data with continuous values requires sorting of training examples for each feature in the quest for an optimal cut-point in the range of feature values in each node. Sorting is an expensive operation in MPC, hence finding secure protocols that avoid such an expensive step is a relevant problem in privacy-preserving machine learning. In this paper we propose three more efficient alternatives for secure training of decision tree based models on data with continuous features, namely: (1) secure discretization of the data, followed by secure training of a decision tree over the discretized data; (2) secure discretization of the data, followed by secure training of a random forest over the discretized data; and (3) secure training of extremely randomized trees (``extra-trees'') on the original data. Approaches (2) and (3) both involve randomizing feature choices. In addition, in approach (3) cut-points are chosen randomly as well, thereby alleviating the need to sort or to discretize the data up front. We implemented all proposed solutions in the semi-honest  setting with additive secret sharing based MPC. In addition to mathematically proving that all proposed approaches are correct and secure, we experimentally evaluated and compared them in terms of classification accuracy and runtime. We privately train tree ensembles over data sets with 1000s of instances or features in a few minutes, with accuracies that are at par with those obtained in the clear.

For this, we develop an LLVM optimizer suite consisting of multiple transform passes that operate on the LLVM intermediate representation (IR) and gradually lower functions to circuit level. Our approach supports various front-end languages (currently C, C++, and Fortran) and takes advantage of powerful source code optimizations built into LLVM. We furthermore make sure to produce circuits that are optimized for MPC, and even offer fully automated post-processing for efficient post-quantum MPC. We empirically measure the quality of our compilation results and compare them to the state-of-the-art specialized MPC compiler HyCC (Büscher et al., CCS'2018). For all benchmarked HyCC example applications (e.g., biomatch and linear equation solving), our highly generalizable approach achieves similar quality in terms of gate count and composition.\",\"date\":\"2021-06-14\",\"url\":\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/797\",\"labelSets\":[],\"previousWorks\":[],\"addedDate\":\"2025-08-15T20:03:09.855Z\",\"folder\":\"\",\"readingStatus\":\"referenced\",\"isPlaceholder\":false,\"scratchpad\":\"\",\"contactEmails\":[\"schneider@encrypto.cs.tu-darmstadt.de\",\"tkachenko@encrypto.cs.tu-darmstadt.de\",\"weinert@encrypto.cs.tu-darmstadt.de\",\"yalame@encrypto.cs.tu-darmstadt.de\"],\"favorite\":false},{\"id\":1755288193107.0713,\"title\":\"On the Privacy of Protocols based on CPA-Secure Homomorphic Encryption\",\"authors\":\"Adi Akavia and Margarita Vald\",\"abstract\":\"Li and Micciancio (Eurocrypt 2021) shattered a widespread misconception regarding the security of protocols based on cpa-secure homomorphic encryption (HE). They showed an attack breaking security of HE-based protocols provided that the protocol employs an HE scheme for approximate numbers, like CKKS, and the adversary sees decrypted ciphertexts. However, their attack fails when employing exact HE schemes, like BGV, or denying access to decrypted data. We show that the Li-Micciancio attack is only the tip of the iceberg: 1)We exhibit an input-recovery attack completely breaking the privacy of a wide and natural family of HE-based protocols, including protocols using only exact HE-schemes and with an adversary exposed solely to encrypted data. This proves that cpa-security is insufficient to ensure privacy in a much broader context than previously known. 2)To address the threat exhibited by our attack we introduce sufficient conditions, on either the encryption scheme or the protocol, that do guarantee privacy: (a) Every HE scheme with a sanitization algorithm (e.g., BGV and FHEW) can be transformed into a ``sanitized\\\" scheme so that protocols instantiated with it preserve privacy against malicious adversaries. (b) Moreover, we characterize a natural sub-family of these protocols for which cpa-security does suffice to guarantee privacy, albeit against semi-honest adversaries. To prove (2a) we define a notion of circuit-privacy+ that lies between semi-honest and malicious circuit-privacy and realize it from existing schemes; this may be of independent interest.

Highly efficient PIR could be used for large-scale applications like Compromised Credential Checking (C3) (USENIX Security'19), which allows users to check whether their credentials have been leaked in a data breach. However, state-of-the art PIR schemes are not efficient enough for fast online responses at this scale. In this work, we introduce Client-Independent Preprocessing (CIP) PIR that moves ( 𝑡 − 1 ) / 𝑛 of the online computation to a local, client independent, preprocessing phase suitable for efficient batch precomputations. The online performance of CIP-PIR improves linearly with the number of servers 𝑛 . We show that large-scale applications like C3 with PIR are practical by implementing our CIP-PIR scheme using a parallelized CPU implementation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-server PIR scheme whose preprocessing phase is completely independent of the client, and where online performance simultaneously improves with the number of servers 𝑛 . In addition, we accelerate for the first time the huge amount of XOR operations in multi-server PIR with GPUs. Our GPU-based CIP-PIR achieves an improvement up to factor 2.1 × over our CPU-based implementation for 𝑛 = 2 servers, and enables a client to query an entry in a 25 GB database within less than 1 second.\",\"date\":\"2021-06-16\",\"url\":\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/823\",\"labelSets\":[],\"previousWorks\":[],\"addedDate\":\"2025-08-15T20:03:19.239Z\",\"folder\":\"\",\"readingStatus\":\"referenced\",\"isPlaceholder\":false,\"scratchpad\":\"\",\"contactEmails\":[\"guenther@encrypto.cs.tu-darmstadt.de\",\"sapp@hotmail.de\",\"benny@pinkas.net\",\"schneider@encrypto.cs.tu-darmstadt.de\"],\"favorite\":false},{\"id\":1755288202268.5713,\"title\":\"Balancing Quality and Efficiency in Private Clustering with Affinity Propagation\",\"authors\":\"Hannah Keller (Helen Möllering, Thomas Schneider, and Hossein Yalame)\",\"abstract\":\"In many machine learning applications, training data consists of sensitive information from multiple sources. Privacy-preserving machine learning using secure computation enables multiple parties to compute on their joint data without disclosing their inputs to each other. In this work, we focus on clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique that partitions data into groups. Previous works on privacy-preserving clustering often leak information and focus on the k-means algorithm, which provides only limited clustering quality and flexibility. Additionally, the number of clusters k must be known in advance. We analyze several prominent clustering algorithms' capabilities and their compatibility with secure computation techniques to create an efficient, fully privacy-preserving clustering implementation superior to k-means. We find affinity propagation to be the most promising candidate and securely implement it using various multi-party computation techniques. Privacy-preserving affinity propagation does not require any input parameters and consists of operations hat are relatively efficient with secure computation. As threat models, we consider passive security as well as active security with an honest and dishonest majority. We offer the first comparison of privacy-preserving clustering between these scenarios, enabling an understanding of the exact trade-offs between them.
