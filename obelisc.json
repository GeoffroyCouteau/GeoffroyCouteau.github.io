A covert computation protocol is one in which parties am run a protocol without knowing if other parties ore also participating in the protocol or not. At the end of the protocol, if all parties participated in the protocol and if the function output is favorable to all parties, then the output is revealed. Ahn et al. constructed a protocol for covert two-partv computation in the random oracle model In this paper, we offer a construction for covert multiparty computation. Our construction is in the standard model and does not require random oracles. In order to achieve this goal, we introduce a number of new techniques. Central to our work is the development of \\\"zero-knowledge proofs to garbled circuits,\\\" which we believe could be of independent interest. Along the way, we also develop a definition of covert computation as per the Ideal/Real model simulation paradigm.\",\"date\":\"2007-09-30\",\"url\":\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389496\",\"labelSets\":[],\"previousWorks\":[],\"addedDate\":\"2025-08-29T12:12:55.936Z\",\"folder\":\"\",\"readingStatus\":\"to-read\",\"isPlaceholder\":false,\"scratchpad\":\"\",\"contactEmails\":[],\"favorite\":false},{\"id\":1756469534999.836,\"title\":\"Covert two-party computation\",\"authors\":\"Luis von Ahn, Luis von Ahn, Nicholas Hopper, Nicholas Hopper, John Langford, John Langford\",\"abstract\":\"We introduce covert two-party computation , a stronger notion of security than standard secure two-party computation. Like standard secure two-party computation, covert two-party computation allows Alice and Bob, with secret inputs x A and x B respectively, to compute a function f(x A ,x B ) without leaking any additional information about their inputs. In addition, covert two-party computation guarantees that even the existence of a computation is hidden from all protocol participants unless the value of the function mandates otherwise. This allows the construction of protocols that return f(x A ,x B ) only when it equals a certain value of interest (such as \\\"Yes, we are romantically interested in each other\\\") but for which neither party can determine whether the other even ran the protocol whenever f(x A ,x B ) is not a value of interest. Since existing techniques for secure function evaluation always reveal that both parties participate in the computation, covert computation requires the introduction of new techniques based on provably secure steganography. We introduce security definitions for covert two-party computation and show that this surprising notion can be achieved by a protocol given the Decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption in the \\\"honest but curious\\\" model. Using this protocol as a subroutine, we present another protocol which is fair and secure against malicious adversaries in the Random Oracle Model --- unlike most other protocols against malicious adversaries, this protocol does not rely on zero-knowledge proofs (or similar cut-and-choose techniques), because they inherently reveal that a computation took place. We remark that all our protocols are of comparable efficiency to protocols for standard secure two-party computation.\",\"date\":\"2005-05-21\",\"url\":\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1060590.1060668\",\"labelSets\":[],\"previousWorks\":[],\"addedDate\":\"2025-08-29T12:12:14.995Z\",\"folder\":\"\",\"readingStatus\":\"to-read\",\"isPlaceholder\":false,\"scratchpad\":\"\",\"contactEmails\":[],\"extensionSavedAt\":\"2025-08-29T12:12:14.999Z\",\"favorite\":false},{\"id\":1756340276512.81,\"title\":\"VerITAS: Verifying Image Transformations at Scale\",\"authors\":\"Trisha Datta (Stanford University), Binyi Chen (Stanford University), Dan Boneh (Stanford University)\",\"abstract\":\"Verifying image provenance has become an important topic, especially in the realm of news media. To address this issue, the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) developed a standard to verify image provenance that relies on digital signatures produced by cameras. However, photos are usually edited before being published, and a signature on an original photo cannot be verified given only the published edited image. In this work, we describe VerITAS, a system that uses zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) to prove that only certain edits have been applied to a signed photo. While past work has created image editing proofs for photos, VerITAS is the first to do so for realistically large images (30 megapixels). Our key innovation enabling this leap is the design of a new proof system that enables proving knowledge of a valid signature on a large amount of witness data. We run experiments on realistically large images that are more than an order of magnitude larger than those tested in prior work. In the case of a computationally weak signer, such as a camera, we are able to generate a proof of valid edits for a 90 MB image in just over thirteen minutes, costing about $0.54 on AWS per image. In the case of a more powerful signer, we are able to generate a proof of valid edits for a 90 MB image in just over three minutes, costing only $0.13 on AWS per image. Either way, proof verification time is less than a second. Our techniques apply broadly whenever there is a need to prove that an efficient transformation was applied correctly to a large amount of signed private data.\",\"date\":\"2024-07-01\",\"url\":\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1066\",\"labelSets\":[],\"previousWorks\":[],\"addedDate\":\"2025-08-28T00:17:56.508Z\",\"folder\":\"\",\"readingStatus\":\"to-read\",\"isPlaceholder\":false,\"scratchpad\":\"\",\"contactEmails\":[],\"favorite\":false},{\"id\":1756307759338.7954,\"title\":\"A New Approach to Practical Active-Secure Two-Party Computation\",\"authors\":\"Jesper Buus Nielsen (Peter Sebastian Nordholt, Claudio Orlandi, and Sai Sheshank Burra)\",\"abstract\":\"We propose a new approach to practical two-party computation secure against an active adversary. All prior practical protocols were based on Yao's garbled circuits. We use an OT-based approach and get efficiency via OT extension in the random oracle model. To get a practical protocol we introduce a number of novel techniques for relating the outputs and inputs of OTs in a larger construction. We also report on an implementation of this approach, that shows that our protocol is more efficient than any previous one: For big enough circuits, we can evaluate more than 20000 Boolean gates per second. As an example, evaluating one oblivious AES encryption (~34000 gates) takes 64 seconds, but when repeating the task 27 times it only takes less than 3 seconds per instance.\",\"date\":\"2011-02-28\",\"url\":\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/091\",\"labelSets\":[{\"name\":\"\",\"labels\":[\"active\",\"covert\"]}],\"previousWorks\":[799],\"addedDate\":\"2025-08-27T15:15:59.333Z\",\"folder\":\"\",\"readingStatus\":\"referenced\",\"isPlaceholder\":false,\"scratchpad\":\"\",\"contactEmails\":[],\"favorite\":false}]",
