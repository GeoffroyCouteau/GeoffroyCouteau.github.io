In the years I spent browsing the stackexchange network, I devoted quite an amount of time answering questions about cryptography, from the most basic questions such as solving homeworks or understanding fundamental concepts, to more advanced questions about recent works, state of the art, and general summaries of what is known on a specific subject. Since some of these answers could possibly be helpful to others, I decided to select the most useful and detailed ones, and I organized them by categories.

- [Q&A about Zero-Knowledge Proofs](/QA-ZK/)
- [Q&A about Cryptographic Primitives and Assumptions](/QA-primitives/)
- [Q&A about Secure Computation](/QA-SC/)
- [Q&A about Foundations of Cryptography](/QA-foundations/)
