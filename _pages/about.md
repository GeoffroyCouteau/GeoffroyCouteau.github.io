I am a CNRS research scientist at [IRIF][irif], Université de Paris. I received my PhD from École Normale Supérieure de Paris ([ENS][ens]) in November 2017, under the supervision of [David Pointcheval](https://www.di.ens.fr/david.pointcheval/index.php) and [Hoeteck Wee](https://www.di.ens.fr/~wee/). In 2017 -- 2019, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology ([KIT][kit]), in the team of [Dennis Hofheinz](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/dhofheinz/).


My main research interests are secure multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proofs (both foundational and practical aspects), as well as the theoretical foundations of cryptography. For an up-to-date list of my publications, you can check my [publication page][publications], my [dblp profile][dblp], or my [Google scholar profile][scholar]. All my publications become available at some point in open access format on the ePrint archive; see the list [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/eprint-bin/search.pl?authornames=Geoffroy). My PhD thesis can  be found [here](/assets/pdf/thesis.pdf).

#### News

**April 2022:** Our Eurocrypt'22 paper, [On Building Fine-Grained One-Way Functions from Strong Average-Case Hardness](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1326.pdf), has been invited to the Journal of Cryptology! In this work, we prove weak feasibility results and strong barriers for basing extremely limited forms of cryptography on powerful average-case hardness assumptions. Working on this paper has been a long, but thrilling journey with my amazing coauthor, Chris Brzuska.

**January 2022:** We just completed a [book chapter](/assets/pdf/HSS_FSS.pdf) for an upcoming book with [Elette Boyle](https://cs.idc.ac.il/~elette/), [Niv Gilboa](https://www.bgu.ac.il/~gilboan/), and [Yuval Ishai](https://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~yuvali/). It is an up-to-date overview of homomorphic secret sharing, function secret sharing, and some of their many applications (including pseudorandom correlation generators). Check it out!

#### Resources

This website contains a few posts which might be useful to students in cryptography, gathered in the [blog](/blog) section. It includes in particular:

- A [LaTeX template](/latex/) for writing research papers in cryptography;
- A [probability cheat sheet](/cheat-sheet/), with basic tools and results that I believe should be part of the cryptographer's toolbox;
- A [Q&A section](/QA/), where I gathered some of my answers to common questions on the [cryptography stackexchange](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/).

#### Students and postdocs

<!--I have fundings for several master internships, research visits, or PhDs. I am always looking for candidates with a strong academic record to work on projects related to secure computation, zero-knowledge proofs, or foundational aspects of cryptography. Interested? Drop me a mail!-->

<!--Currently, I am specifically looking for a master student to work on a project related to secure computation and coding theory during the period March 2021 -- September 2021 (other periods can be envisioned depending on the student constraints). There is a possibility of continuing this internship as a PhD. You might want to check the [internship proposal](/assets/pdf/internship_codes.pdf).-->

I have the pleasure to advise several amazing PhD students, and I will not be accepting any new PhD requests in the next few years. However, I might have openings for postdocs. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, secure computation, zero-knowledge proofs, post-quantum cryptography, code-based cryptography, and foundational aspects of cryptography (including black-box separations and connections to learning theory).

If you are interested, send me a mail and consider applying to the [openings](https://www.irif.fr/postes/postdoc) of the Algorithm and Complexity team of IRIF (around October 2022).
